    Hello everyone, this is a simple tool I wrote to simplify my tasks as a pentester within the company. It detects all the live IPs and helps filter my testing. Instead of using the traditional Nmap scan, I utilized a better way to scan the entire range using a custom script based on PING. The logic of the code is as follows:

<pre>
    ./check 172.16.11
    OR
    ./check 172.16.11 OUTPUT-FILE
</pre>
